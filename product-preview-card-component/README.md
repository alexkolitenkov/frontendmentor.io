## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass preprocessor(CSS custom properties, Flexbox)
- Gulp

### What I learned

For this challenge I've used Sass preprocessor and Gulp for the first time, so my code and folder organization may be messy and as a whole looks like amateur's work,
but I wanted to go beyond regular CSS stylesheets and tried to automate the whole layout process, so I've tried Sass/Gulp combination for this purpose.

Of course, I couldn't have done anything without ordinary CSS, but at the same time I've learned about variables, mixins, splitting stylesheets into modules and few other things in Sass.
Also, for this project I used Gulp for browser synchronizing with my code I wrote live, so I could see all changes made to Sass files immediately.
